# 2026-02-26 — Daily Memory

## Landing Page Shipped 🚀
- Built standalone Next.js landing page for openlabelai.com
- Dark theme (matching investor deck), no pricing, waitlist-driven
- 9 sections: Nav, Hero, Problem, HowItWorks, Features, Moat, Founder, FinalCTA, Footer
- Waitlist form with role selector, referral codes, queue position, share buttons, Founding Artist badge (first 500)
- Prisma schema: WaitlistEntry + PageView tables
- UTM tracking, referral counting
- Repo: `openlabelai/openlabel-site` (GitHub, private)
- **Deployed on Vercel** (not Railway — Railway had persistent build failures)
- Vercel token: `REDACTED_VERCEL_TOKEN`
- **Supabase free tier** for Postgres: project ref `xpuhbtbftrtdawaehtda`, host `aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543`, user `postgres.xpuhbtbftrtdawaehtda`, pass `jpc2kqy_ajg8gbw6FKZ`
- DB schema pushed manually via psql (pooler connection worked, direct didn't from container)
- Custom domain `openlabelai.com` added to Vercel — needs Cloudflare DNS: A record → `76.76.21.21`
- Next.js upgraded to 15.5.12 (15.3.3 and 15.3.4 both blocked by Vercel CVE-2025-66478)
- Live at: https://openlabel-site.vercel.app

## Investor Deck Analyzed
- Seb sent 14-page PDF: `The_Music_Intelligence_Layer-compressed.pdf`
- Key data: $2.5B unclaimed royalties, $427M MLC unmatched, $775M Downtown acquisition, $50B TAM, $13.7B SAM
- Competitive quadrant: OpenLabel = AI-Native + Deep Intelligence
- Pricing in deck: Free / Pro $299/yr / Enterprise (different from app pricing)
- Seb decided: NO pricing on landing page, dark theme

## YC Application v3
- Reworked with deck messaging at `Obsidian/Henry/YC-APPLICATION-DRAFT-V3.md`
- Stronger data points, competitive quadrant framing, identity resolution as switching cost
- New 50-char: "AI that reads any royalty report instantly."
- Landing page checklist item ✅
- Still needs: founder video, demo video, Seb's review

## Forensic Intelligence — Major Strategic Pivot
- Seb's direction: "Displaying data doesn't cut it. We need to be a forensic investigator."
- Spec written: `docs/TASK-FORENSIC-INTELLIGENCE-V1.md` (4 rules, API, tests)
- Dev plan created (4 phases):
  - Phase 0: Entity Resolution (prerequisite for cross-source forensics)
  - Phase 1: Single-source rules (rate drop, period anomaly) — ship immediately
  - Phase 2: Cross-source (territory gaps, collection gap, missing payments)
  - Phase 3: Audit engine (statute of limitations, reconciliation, PDF reports)
  - Phase 4: AI moat (MLC scanner, forecasting, identity graphs)
- Key insight: reconciliation must come before anomaly detection (from Jaques financial research)
- Single-source vs cross-source split: rate monitor + period anomaly work without entity resolution; missing royalty type + territory gaps need it

## Jaques Research Completed
- `FORENSIC-ROYALTY-COMPETITORS.md` — 18 companies profiled, 7 market gaps identified
  - Claimy (Paris, $1.8M) is closest competitor — France/UK only, publishing only
  - BMG StreamSight has the anomaly taxonomy to emulate
  - MLC black box scan = best acquisition hook
  - Statute of limitations = urgency-creating UX
- `FINANCIAL-FORENSICS-RESEARCH.md` — methods, libraries, best practices
  - Recommended stack: rule engine + robust Z-score (Phase 1) → Python microservice with PyOD/ADTK (Phase 2)
  - Key: get reconciliation right before anomaly detection

## Dex Agent Setup (Codex 5.3)
- Seb requested new agent: Dex as Senior Engineer on OpenAI Codex 5.3
- Confirmed: existing OpenAI API key has access to `gpt-5.3-codex`
- Added Dex to `openclaw.json`: model `openai/gpt-5.3-codex`, workspace `/host/home`
- Created agent dir, workspace, AGENTS.md, symlinked auth
- **BUG**: Config existed in TWO locations: `/app/openclaw-state/openclaw.json` AND `/home/node/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. Gateway reads from the latter. Copied updated config to both.
- Gateway restart needed to activate. Still pending verification.
- Team: Henry (Opus) → Dex (Codex 5.3) → Linus (Sonnet) → Jaques (Sonnet) → Suri (Sonnet)
- Plan: Dex handles entity resolution, Linus handles forensic rules, parallel tracks

## Obsidian Vault Path Updated
- Correct path: `/host/home/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/OBSIDIAN/` (container) = `/Users/openlabel/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/OBSIDIAN` (Mac)
- Updated MEMORY.md with correct path
- Old `/host/home/Obsidian/` was empty

## Railway
- Railway token: `37b90ab6-e7a9-4ef1-bba0-a5018ae5608d` (workspace `94e41a0e-968f-4d28-954f-b59c504c93d6`)
- Created project `openlabel-site` (ID `cf9fd05c-aa88-4fe3-ad35-0595f651641c`) with Postgres + web service
- Multiple deploy failures — switched to Vercel instead
- Railway project can be deleted/reused later

## Decisions
- Dark theme for landing page (matching deck aesthetic)
- No pricing on landing page — mystery/waitlist only
- Vercel + Supabase over Railway for landing page
- Next.js 15.5.12 (not 15.3.x — Vercel blocks vulnerable versions)
- Forensic intelligence is the new core value prop, not just data display
- Entity resolution is prerequisite for cross-source forensics
- Parallel dev: single-source forensics + entity resolution simultaneously
- Dex (Codex 5.3) = Senior Engineer for hard architectural work
- Don't build audio fingerprinting — partner with Pex/ACRCloud if needed

## STT / Voice Notes
- Configured OpenAI API key in openclaw.json for audio transcription (gpt-4o-mini-transcribe)
- STT working on Telegram — Seb sent voice notes successfully

## Grand Vision Conversation
- Seb laid out the full vision for OpenLabel via voice notes
- **"Label in a box"** — everything an indie artist/small label needs
- Three layers: Data Intelligence → Release/Collaboration Management → Conversational AI Agent
- Collaborative: splits, shared access for co-writers/producers
- Conversational: Lovable-style chat UI with canvas, voice-native
- Must also be an API service other agents can access (MCP)
- Data layer stays priority — it's the moat that makes the rest valuable

## Architecture Review
- Reviewed full codebase: schema, parsers, routes, services
- All current APIs are agent-ready ✅
- Key gaps identified: no canonical Artist/Track/Work entities, no MCP server
- Identity resolution needed before collaboration features
- Created `/host/home/dev/openlabel/docs/VISION.md` — comprehensive architecture north star
- Updated MEMORY.md with grand vision and architecture assessment

## Agent Model Switch
- All sub-agents switched from MiniMax M2 to Claude Sonnet 4 (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
- Seb's decision: Sonnet for building, Opus for architecting + reviewing
- Dev loop: Henry specs → Linus builds on Sonnet → Henry reviews → Seb merges

## Sub-Agent Pairing Fix
- `sessions_spawn` was failing with "pairing required" for all agents
- Root cause: pending device re-pair request in `~/.openclaw/devices/pending.json` needing `operator.write` scope
- Fixed by approving the pending request and adding scope to paired.json
- Linus successfully spawned on `feature/query-layer-v2` after fix

## Query Layer V2
- Seb directed: parsers paused (no new report files), focus on making query layer exhaustive
- Identified 8 missing query capabilities (all fields already stored, just need endpoints)
- Wrote full spec: `docs/specs/QUERY-LAYER-V2.md`
- Linus building it now on branch `feature/query-layer-v2`

## Also updated memory.md (root level duplicate)
- Note: there's both `/host/home/MEMORY.md` and `/host/home/memory.md` — should consolidate
